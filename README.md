### About

This project shows how to create a proxy datasource on top of a real one within a Spring Boot application. 
The application uses a special **BeanPostProcessor** in order to create the proxy object based on the auto-configured bean.

The project is created for the following blog post: http://blog.arnoldgalovics.com/2017/06/26/configuring-a-datasource-proxy-in-spring-boot/
